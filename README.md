# AI Video Generator ðŸš€ðŸŽ¥

This project brings AI and automation together to generate dynamic video content using text-to-speech, image processing, and AI-driven enhancements. Whether you're creating AI-narrated clips or experimenting with OpenAI-powered content, this notebook has you covered!

âœ¨ [Watch the sample final output here!](https://github.com/mmasoumipy/ai_video/raw/refs/heads/main/final_ai_video2.mp4)

## Features
- Uses **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)** for voice synthesis (optional/can use OpenAI as well).
- Processes images using **PIL (Pillow)**.
- Leverages **OpenAI's API** for AI-powered tasks.
- Utilizes **requests** for HTTP requests.
- Handles in-memory data operations with **io**.


## Installation
To run this notebook, install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mmasoumipy/ai_video.git
